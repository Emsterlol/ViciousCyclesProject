    <h2>Vicious Cycles</h2>
    <p>Our store carries a wide variety of bikes:</p>
    <ul>Bikes: These are designed for smooth, paved roads and are perfect for long-distance rides. They have lightweight frames, thin tires, and drop handlebars for aerodynamics.</ul> 
    <ul>Mountain Bikes: These bikes are designed for off-road adventures and rough terrains. They have wider tires, suspension systems, and stronger frames.</ul> 
    <ul>Hybrid Bikes: As the name suggests, these bikes are a hybrid of road and mountain bikes, offering the best of both worlds. They have wider tires than road bikes but not as wide as mountain bikes, and are perfect for commuting or light trail riding.</ul>
    <ul>Motor Bikes: These bikes have a small electric motor that assists the rider while pedaling, making it easier to tackle hills or ride longer distances without getting tired.</ul> 
    <ul>Folding Bikes: These bikes are perfect for commuters or people with limited storage space. They can be folded up and easily stored in a small space, such as a closet or car trunk.</ul>
